      <b>Transfer systems in equivariant homotopy theory</b><br>
An operad is an object that encodes a type of algebraic structure in homotopical contexts. For instance, the E<sub>&#8734;</sub>-operad encodes the homotopical notion of commutative monoid. In equivariant homotopy theory, G-commutative monoids are encoded by the N<sub>&#8734;</sub>-operads of Blumberg—Hill. In contrast to E<sub>&#8734;</sub>-operads, the category of N<sub>&#8734;</sub>-operads is far from trivial, and its homotopy category is equivalent to a category of combinatorial objects called G-transfer systems. I will introduce transfer systems from scratch and discuss various examples, such as those coming from little disks and linear isometries operads, the G-operads which canonically model “additive” and “multiplicative” structures, respectively. Time permitting, I will discuss ongoing joint work with DeMark, Hill, Niu, Stoeckl, Van Niel, and Yan, studying which pairs of G-transfer systems are sufficiently "compatible" to encode the additive and multiplicative structures of a “ring”.

      <b> Vector fields on spheres </b><br>
      We will examine a classical problem in topology: How many linearly independent vector fields can exist on an n-dimensional sphere? This problem has been widely studied and was definitively answered by Adams in his 1962 paper. In this talk, we will discuss the key ideas behind the solution, offering an introduction to some important concepts and techniques in classical homotopy theory.

    <b> The fundamental group of a topos, and its applications to memory management </b><br>
    The Galois correspondence between &#x3C0;<sub>1</sub>(X)-representations and covering spaces has been extended to sites and topoi. The fundamental group of a topos describes the isotropy around a topos point, and is the first homotopy group of the shape of the topos. When building memory models in a programming language, memory is organized into a Grothendieck topology, and the fundamental group of the associated topos is an invariant describing how regions in computer memory may be stitched together. The first half of this talk will construct the fundamental group of a topos. The second half will describe its applications to memory management. This talk is based on conversations about “A Nominal Approach to Probabilistic Separation Logic” (2024) by John Li, et al.

      <b> A Deligne-Mumford stratification of elliptic cohomology with level structure </b><br>
      Level structure is an essential aspect of the classical theory of modular forms and elliptic curves, and it plays a similarly important role in elliptic cohomology and its applications to physics and stable homotopy theory. The classical theory doesn’t carry over cleanly to the spectral case, however, because level structures and their associated isogenies can fail to be étale. This talk concerns a new approach I have developed for understanding elliptic cohomology with (possibly ramified) level structure. By studying the effect of isogenies on the dualizing line, I obtain a tractable invariant characterizing “how ramified” an isogeny is. This invariant can be used to filter the abstract moduli stack of isogenies between oriented elliptic curves, ultimately producing a stratification by Deligne-Mumford stacks.

      <b> Orientations: Classical and Motivic </b> <br>
      The notion of complex orientations on ring spectra played a fundamental role in the development of chromatic homotopy theory. Complex orientations are closely connected to the theory of Chern classes and formal group laws, and it is a classical result that the complex cobordism spectrum MU carries a universal complex orientation that induces the universal formal group law. There is a completely analogous notion of orientations of motivic ring spectra, and Voevodsky conjectured that a similar statement is true for the algebraic cobordism spectrum MGL over any regular local base scheme. This hasn't been proven in its full generality but some partial results are known, inlcuding a result by Hoyois (building on works from Levine, Hopkins and Morel) that this is true over fields once you invert the exponential characteristic and a later extension due to Spitzweck to motivic spectra over local rings pro-smooth over a DVR of mixed characteristic, again after inverting the characteristic. In this talk, we will discuss the classical theory of complex orientations and its motivic analogue. If time permits, we will discuss the proof of these motivic results and the difficulties at the characteristic.

      <b> The moment map and equivariant cohomology </b>
      I will talk about Atiyah and Bott’s paper “the moment map and equivariant cohomology”. 

If time permits, I will talk about the more general perspective of Goresky, Kottwitz, MacPherson that the cohomology of equivariantly formal spaces can be computed from the structure of the zero and one dimensional orbits of a maximal torus.
